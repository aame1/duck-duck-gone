## 0. Set-Up


__A User can see my initial repository and live demo__

### Repo

- Generate from Template
- Write initial, basic README
- Turn on GitHub Pages



## 1. User Story: First Looks and Feels of a Search-Engine

> assigned to Abdul 

__As a user I want to be able to see a straight-forward purpose of this website with a navigation bar__

### Repo

- I propose I create a branch called `1-header-nav`and another `2-search-bar` to work on the header.

### HTML

- a header element needs to be added where the search bar will also be included since this is also the main part of the page 

### CSS

- css styles proper to the header element

## 2. User Story: Sections

> assigned to  `to be assigned`

__As a user, I want to introduce the users to the extra functionalites of the website.__ 

_We need to discuss if we want to create one branch per section or we make only one branch for all three sections and assign it to one user


### HTML 

## 3.  User Story: Footer and Image 

_To be discussed with the team_

## 4. User Story:  Final Adjustements 

_As a front end developer I want to make the last adjustements before going live_
